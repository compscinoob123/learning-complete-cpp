x = y+f(2)
/* For this equation to actually work in c++, you must declare them. */

float x; //x is a floating point varaible
int y = 7; //y is an integer variable with the initial value 7
float f(int); //f is declared to be a function that takes an 'int' as an argument, so it can be called given the integer 2
